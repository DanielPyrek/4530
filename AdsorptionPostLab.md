**1)** Here are the breakthrough curves for  the tests without any activated carbon. They seem quite consistent, each with fast breakthroughs. The  test at 2.6 microliters per second seemed to breakthrough faster than 2 out of 3 of the tests at 0.5 microliters per second. This could indicate that faster flow rates cause faster breakthroughs.

*Graph 1: Sand Breakthrough Curves*


Here is the breakthrough curve for the tests with activated carbon. The more carbon in the column, the longer it took for the test to breakthrough. The yellow line with 29.3 g of carbon took a very long time to breakthrough.

*Graph 2: Activated Carbon Breakthrough Curves*

**2)** Here is a plot showing the time when the effluent concentration 50% versus mass of activated carbon. It seems like the general trend is that the time to reach 50% increases with mass of activated carbon. This is especially apparent with the 29.3g of carbon test.

*Graph 3: Time till the effluent concentration was 50%*

**3)** The retardation factors for the 4 sand tests are: 1.60610114, 1.54779162, 1.2722501 , 1.23448781.These are all very low because sand did not do a good job at adsorbing the red dye.

The retardation factors for activated carbon are as follows: 1.29059221,   1.1186696 ,   3.57505897, 5.23205059, 0.66971197,   5.66348582,  23.58041714,   6.83584163, 171.07142729. These are increasing order of tests from least to most activated carbon. It is quite clear that increasing the mass of activated carbon increases the retardation factor. Adding less than a gram of carbon resembled pure sand whereas almost 30 grams of carbon increased the retardation factor to 171.

**4)** We calculated the value of qo for each of the columns based on equation (97). The mass of adsorbate per mass of adsorbent resembles graph 3. As the mass of activated increases, qo seemed to increase as well.

**Suggestions/Comments**
Overall, the lab was enjoyable and visually interesting. The initial set up was slightly confusing given the vast amount of tubing, valves, and other components necessary for a proper apparatus. However, with Jonathanâ€™s own version of the set up next to us, we were able to finish building the experiment. Apart from that, our only issues were from the code during our post lab analysis. Some of the data varied in time collected and amount of carbon used, with made comparisons difficult to execute. Additionally, some of the code was complicated and required more python skill than we comfortably had. This included several if statements and nested for-loops for question #2. Otherwise, the adsorption lab was productive and aided us in our final experiment.

**Conclusion**
It was concluded that an increase in the amount of activated carbon (in mg/L) caused the adsorption curve to break through at a later point. Additionally, higher flow rates caused earlier breakthroughs. From the graphs, is seemed as though as activated carbon mass increased, two things happened: the time when the effluent concentration was 50% and q0 increased.
