Research Proposal**

**Intro/context – What is the problem? Why is it important**

The goal of this experiment was to test if charcoal is a viable alternative to activated carbon, sand with coagulants, sand, charcoal, and charcoal treated with calcium chloride. This is an important question for communities with limited resources who are in need of clean, filtered water. Activated carbon, while incredibly effective as an adsorbent in water treatment, is currently expensive and difficult to obtain in rural areas. Charcoal, on the other hand, requires little effort and resources. Should charcoal that has been soaked in calcium chloride prove a viable option for water adsorption, it would benefit many communities with cheap ,accessible, and clean water.

**Objectives – What is the hypothesis? What will you do to test the hypothesis?**

The hypothesis expected that charcoal would be less effective than activated carbon, sand with coagulants, sand, or charcoal activated with calcium chloride. Each material was tested with varying flow rates, volumes

**Experimental plan including – How will you measure it?**

An apparatus was constructed similar to the one used in the adsorption lab. See the diagram below. The directional valves allow the experimenters to flush out air from the column, and then reverse the flow direction. The dye was pumped using two flow rates for each material. The concentration of dye in each trial was measured with a photometer.

In order to create salt treated charcoal:
Obtain charcoal
Grind it up to 1 - 5 mm grain
Soak in 50% NaCl or 25% CaCl2 solution for 24 hours
Bake/aerate till dry


**Key Design Parameters**
* Adsorbent Material
* Constant Mass with similar grain size

**Timeline of Tasks/Experiments**

**4/12**
Sand - 0.5 mL/s

**4/15**
Sand w/ Coagulant - 0.5 mL/s

**4/15 - 4/19**
Treated Charcoal - 0.5 mL/s
Activated Carbon - 0.5 mL/s


**4/22**
Charcoal - 0.5 mL/s


**Possible Hurdles/Challenges**
	The presence of air bubbles proved a possible issue. Reverse osmosis water must be pumped into the column from the bottom, as well as through all the connecting tubes, to ensure that all the air is released from the apparatus. Any air in the column or the photometer will result in experimental failure. Surface tension between the air and the activated carbon, or other media, can create additional difficulty in removing the bubbles.
Another minor hurdle expected was the time demand of activated carbon. A column composed entirely of activated carbon would require multiple days for the mass transfer zone breakthrough to plateau. This caused inconveniences because it required additional stops at the lab to refill the water and add specific amounts of dye.

**Resources needed to conduct experiments – What tools will you use?**
* Peristaltic pump
* Activated carbon
* Charcoal
* Calcium Chloride
* Sand
* Coagulant
* 6 Directional Valves
* Tubing
* Column
* Red Dye
* Ionized Water
* Containers to store ionized water and dye




**Expectations/Anticipated results**

* Obtain values of red dye concentration over time from photometer readings
* Plot the breakthrough curves showing C/C0 versus time.
* Find the time when the effluent concentration was 50% of the influent concentration and plot that as a function of the mass for each material.
* Calculate the retardation coefficient (Radsorption) based on the time to breakthrough for the columns for each material.
* Calculate the q0 for each of the columns based on equation (97).
* This value estimates the mass of adsorbate per mass of adsorbent. Comparing these values will illuminate which material was the best adsorbent.
* Expectations for adsorbent quality from worst to best are: sand, charcoal, treated charcoal, sand with coagulant, activated charcoal.
